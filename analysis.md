# Research Market Analysis

## 1. What question are you trying to answer?
To what extent do shifts in financial news sentiment and key thematic trends predict or correlate with market performance over time?

## 2. Why is this question worth answering?
Understanding the link between financial news sentiment and market performance will allow me to better predict the stock market then just using past and present information of the stock price. This will allow me to create a better trading bot that understands the market better. 

## 3. What is your hypothesis? Why does it lead you towards that hypothesis?

**Hypothesis:**  
*There is a statistically significant relationship between the sentiment expressed in financial news and subsequent market performance, such that periods of highly negative or positive sentiment are predictive of market downturns or upswings.*

**Rationale:**
*Literature in behavioral finance shows that finance bros tend to react to the media and world events which would drive market dynamics. This is especially apparent when there's economic crashes but also shows during upturns as well.*

## 4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question?
I will use [FNSPID: A Comprehensive Financial News Dataset in Time Series](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zihan1004/FNSPID). It's around 25GB.
